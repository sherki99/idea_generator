        Context from research:
        - Niche opportunities: {json.dumps([n.model_dump() for n in niches], indent=2)}
        - Pain points: {json.dumps([p.model_dump() for p in pain_points], indent=2) if pain_points else "None"}
        - Personas: {json.dumps([p.model_dump() for p in personas], indent=2) if personas else "None"}
        - Market trends: {json.dumps([t.model_dump() for t in market_trends], indent=2) if 'market_trends' in locals() else "None"}

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULE:
        - Only generate business ideas if they are clearly supported by **evidence from the research above** (personas, pain points, or trends).
        - If no strong evidence exists, respond with: 
        "⚠️ No sufficiently validated opportunities identified from the current research. Recommend expanding research scope before generating ideas."

        For each validated idea, provide:
        1. **Problem Statement** – A specific, evidence-backed pain point in the niche.
        2. **Evidence** – Quote or summarize the supporting research (persona insight, trend, or pain point).
        3. **Why Agents/Workflows are Required** – Why this solution requires multi-agent systems (not just a chatbot).
        4. **Workflow Design** – Example of LangChain/LangGraph architecture (agents, tools, interactions).
        5. **Unique Value Proposition** – Why this solution is different and valuable.
        6. **Target Persona** – Who pays for this and why.
        7. **Monetization Strategy** – SaaS model, API, enterprise, etc.
